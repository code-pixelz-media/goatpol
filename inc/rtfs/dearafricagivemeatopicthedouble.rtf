\pard\nowidctlpar {{\cf0\f0 It launches fast, as soon as the sun falls. When it sets behind the distant hills and the skies shout with colours of twilight.It comes as soon as the sky erupts in shadows and all nature\uc0{\u8217}s forms are dramatic silhouettes.Africa talking about you is impossible for me}}\par
