\pard\nowidctlpar {{\cf0\f0 I\uc0{\u8217}m a single mother with two kids, and every day feels like a constant struggle. It\uc0{\u8217}s not just about the lack of a partner to share the burden with, but also about the financial and emotional challenges that come with raising two children on my own.}}\par
\pard\nowidctlpar {{\cf0\f0 I wake up at 5 am every day to prepare breakfast for my kids and get them ready for school. After dropping them off, I head to my job, where I work 8 hours a day as a cashier at a local supermarket. It\uc0{\u8217}s not a glamorous job, but it pays the bills and puts food on the table.}}\par
\pard\nowidctlpar {{\cf0\f0 Once I\uc0{\u8217}m done with work, I rush back home to pick up my kids from school. Then it\uc0{\u8217}s back to the kitchen to cook dinner, help them with their homework, and get them ready for bed. By the time they\uc0{\u8217}re asleep, I\uc0{\u8217}m exhausted, and all I want to do is crawl into bed and get some rest.}}\par
\pard\nowidctlpar {{\cf0\f0 But there\uc0{\u8217}s no time for rest when you\uc0{\u8217}re a single mom. There are bills to pay, groceries to buy, and household chores to take care of. I try to keep up with everything, but it\uc0{\u8217}s tough. Some days, I feel like I\uc0{\u8217}m drowning, and there\uc0{\u8217}s no one to turn to for help.}}\par
\pard\nowidctlpar {{\cf0\f0 I often worry about my children\uc0{\u8217}s future. I want them to have the best life possible, but it\uc0{\u8217}s hard to provide that on my own. I worry about their education, their health, and their emotional well-being. I want to be there for them every step of the way, but it\uc0{\u8217}s not always possible when I\uc0{\u8217}m juggling so many responsibilities.}}\par
\pard\nowidctlpar {{\cf0\f0 Despite all the challenges, I\uc0{\u8217}m grateful for my children. They give me a reason to keep going, even on the toughest days. I know that I\uc0{\u8217}m not alone in this struggle, and there are many other single mothers out there who are going through the same thing.}}\par
\pard\nowidctlpar {{\cf0\f0 I may not have all the answers, but I\uc0{\u8217}m doing the best I can. And I know that with love, determination, and a little bit of help from the community, I can provide a bright future for my children.}}\par
