\pard\nowidctlpar {{\cf0\f0 To reach Basel, Switzerland, I often fly into the aiport at Freiburg. Many low-fare airlines use it, and it has the unusual advantage of sitting at the intersection of three different countries. When you get off the airplane in Frieburg and collect your luggage, you are given the option of walking through any one of three doors: one that exits into Switzerland; one that exits into Germany; and a third that exits into France. This seems to me to be an auspicious airport for anyone who seeks flexibility in their encounters with the nation-state.}}\par
