\pard\nowidctlpar {{\cf0\f0 My linesIn one of the Quranic centers, an educational and cultural program was held twice every month, a number of women including mothers , youths and teenagers.They will be present in this program.on one of the autumn days, when the weather was relatively colder, we had a program there and according to the usual routine, I was supposed to give a speech.As we got closer to the opening moments of the program, my heart best faster and faster, I felt that something unpleasant was going to happen, the world was dark infront of my eyes. when I looked at the people present in the congregation, whose number could not be counted, even some sisters were standing in the corridor and a smile filled with anxiety was visible on my lips. But there was still that strange feeling deep in my heart. One of the officials there called me and said : You must cancel the program, because a new decree issued by the Islamic Emirate(Taliban) has been approved that all centers where\uc0{\u160} women are implementing the programs will be closed until further notice, and it is possible that our Quranic center will also be blocked.I asked the officials there to allow us to hold at least this meeting. some issues were exchanged between us, finally we were able to finish our curriculum.I felt that I was alone in that crowd, it was very difficult for me how to tell all these people who are gathered here only for their God that our Islamic Emirate is not allowing women to participate in these events although we are gathered in this holy place to the word of God and that great character.It is forbidden to review the man of the world together so that he can cultivate our dusty hearts done.I ended my talk with a speech, and in the end, I asked for good prayers from all the audience and those present there.An this is how I said goodbye to them.My noble and chaste sisters!!!I apologize for saying this, due to some of the issues that we have been witnessing lately.We are going to spend some time without this program.God willing, we will come back here after some time and continue our lessons.It was 3:49AM when I opened the door of the library and looked at the books, this was the same library that my religious sisters and I had sweated day and night for its establishment.It was decided to move the books to the house, I brought the books to the house with one of my sisters and moved them.My cellphone rang behind my sisters who were among my colleagues and friends.They were crying and they said:Why did it happen like this?Were we doing something against Shariat?Aren\uc0{\u8217}t we right?I did not know what to say!I recited hopeful verses and words for them \uc0{\u8211} and somehow I was controlling their emotions.I was not feeling well at all, I got up, took ablution and started reciting the Holy Quran, because this was the only way to calm my heart .When I opened the Quran, my eyes fell on this verse.And we do not know that your chest is narrow, they say to us, praise the lord and do the prostrations, and worship the lord, even if you are in good hands.I don\uc0{\u8217}t\uc0{\u160} think that this verse hit my eyes by chance, rather it is as if god wanted to introduce me to this matter suddenly my anger burst!And I started to cry, I cried until I calmed down.And I got strength from these verses, and until today none of my sisters and friends know what was the reason for my strength when ever I am lacking and difficulties overcome me, He alone is my helper and master!I am grateful to God Almighty for accepting me as his servant, for making Islamic my religion and for making Muhammad Mustafa (peace be upon him) my prophet and role model.}}\par
