\pard\nowidctlpar {{\cf0\f0 You may ask, what\uc0{\u8217}s the meaning of life?The meaning of life is to live a life of meaning, a life committed to a greater purpose, a life that transcends mere existence, a life that truly counts.}}\par
\pard\nowidctlpar {{\cf0\f0 You may have experienced moments in life where everything seems pointless, and the weight of suffering feels unbearable.}}\par
\pard\nowidctlpar {{\cf0\f0 It\uc0{\u8217}s during these times that the importance of a meaningful life becomes apparent. Without purpose or direction, it can feel like you\uc0{\u8217}re simply existing rather than truly living.}}\par
\pard\nowidctlpar {{\cf0\f0 But a meaningful life gives you a reason to keep going. It offers a sense of fulfillment and satisfaction that goes beyond material possessions or temporary pleasures.}}\par
\pard\nowidctlpar {{\cf0\f0 When you have a purpose that inspires you, you can weather the storms of life with greater resilience and determination.}}\par
\pard\nowidctlpar {{\cf0\f0 And you may ask, what\uc0{\u8217}s a meaningful life?}}\par
\pard\nowidctlpar {{\cf0\f0 It\uc0{\u8217}s a life committed to a greater purpose, a life that entails using what you have for the benefit of mankind.}}\par
\pard\nowidctlpar {{\cf0\f0 A meaningful life is discovering who you are, your place in the world and doing your utmost best to alleviate the sufferings in the world.}}\par
\pard\nowidctlpar {{\cf0\f0 There may be suffering in the world, but a meaningful life allows you to rise above it. It enables you to make a positive impact on others, to pursue your passions, and to find joy in the simple things.}}\par
\pard\nowidctlpar {{\cf0\f0 So don\uc0{\u8217}t give up hope, keep striving towards a meaningful life. Because when you do, you\uc0{\u8217}ll find that suffering becomes more bearable, and life becomes more worthwhile.}}\par
\pard\nowidctlpar {{\cf0\f0 And yes, you will not be able to alleviate all the suffering in this world, but a meaningful life is having the courage to contribute your quota, no matter how little it is and inspiring others to do the same.}}\par
\pard\nowidctlpar {{\cf0\f0 And if each of us can daily commit to changing the lives of those around us, this world will be a better place to live in, today and forever.}}\par
