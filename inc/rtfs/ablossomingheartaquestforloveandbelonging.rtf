\pard\nowidctlpar {{\cf0\f0 During a scenic day, under the azure sky and middle of blooming flowers harmonising with jubilant bird songs, lies Steve, immersed in the embrace of nature\uc0{\u8217}s beauty. Filled with an insatiable thirst for knowledge, his mind brims with questions, yearning to unveil the mysteries of the world.}}\par

\pard\nowidctlpar {{\cf0\f0 Steve, a vibrant soul brimming with energy, love, and ambition, envisioned himself as a chosen protagonist destined to uplift his family from poverty,\uc0{\u160} promising his beloved family members especially to his beloved grandma that he vowed to acquire the world for them in a silver plate. His heart overflowed with compassion and empathy, earning him the endearing title of \uc0{\u8217}the embodiment of love.\uc0{\u8217} From a young age, he instinctively extended a helping hand to those in need, endearing himself to the community regardless of his tender years. Yet, the cruel twist of fate, akin to the sinking of Atlantis, shattered his idyllic dreams. The separation of his parents plunged him into a tumult of confusion and sorrow, akin to the flower ceasing to yield nectar to the bee, and the bee forsaking its floral sanctuary}}\par

\pard\nowidctlpar {{\cf0\f0 Denied the autonomy to choose his caregiver, Steve\uc0{\u8217}s tender heart endured the absence of his mother\uc0{\u8217}s affection from a tender age. After relocating to a foreign land to reunite with his cherished father, whom he regarded as his closest confidant, Steve realized that the man he believed he knew was a stranger. The sole individual he trusted had forsaken him, leaving Steve feeling abandoned and isolated, enveloped by despair, once a cherished confidant, unravelled a bitter truth: familiarity masked deception. Steve found himself relegated to the role of a servant in his father\uc0{\u8217}s domain, his youthful dreams eclipsed by the harsh reality of familial discord.}}\par

\pard\nowidctlpar {{\cf0\f0 The new mother, tasked with Steve\uc0{\u8217}s upbringing and treating him as her own, subjected Steve to servitude within his father\uc0{\u8217}s household. He endured a childhood marked by misery and hardship under his father\uc0{\u8217}s roof.}}\par
\pard\nowidctlpar {{\cf0\f0 \uc0{\u160}}}\par
\pard\nowidctlpar {{\cf0\f0 Emotions roiled within him; anger and confusion, unable to comprehend the sudden shift from paradise to turmoil. Despite the challenges, strangers offered him solace, a form of closure foreign to his father\uc0{\u8217}s house. Yet, Steve remained unbroken, clinging to the values instilled by his mother: respect, empathy, and the belief in the cyclical nature of kindness and justice.}}\par

He remained steadfast in his embodiment of love, empathy, and sympathy, navigating society with ease. His compassionate demeanour drew people to him, gradually lifting him out of the abyss of sorrow, despair, and isolation as he formed meaningful friendships. Among these friends, one stood out Luke, who transcended mere companionship to become akin to a twin brother to Steve.}}\par

\pard\nowidctlpar {{\cf0\f0 Luke, aware of Steve\uc0{\u8217}s dilemma, extended an invitation for Steve to reside with his own family. Embracing Luke\uc0{\u8217}s offer, Steve was welcomed with open arms by Luke\uc0{\u8217}s mother and siblings, finding solace in a familial embrace that seemed like a distant dream. He found a sense of belonging he had never experienced in his father\uc0{\u8217}s household. Over the course of two and a half decades, Steve flourished under the nurturing guidance of Luke\uc0{\u8217}s mother, achieving remarkable feats and fulfilling his aspirations. However, driven by his innate curiosity and boundless love, empathy, and sympathy, Steve felt compelled to revisit his father\uc0{\u8217}s home, yearning for reconciliation and the opportunity to bridge the gap of lost time between them.}}\par
