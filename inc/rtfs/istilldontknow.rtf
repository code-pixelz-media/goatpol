\pard\nowidctlpar {{\cf0\f0 I was in the yard, next to our green garden. Full of flowers, one more beautiful than the other. The greenery and smell of flowers and grass is a wonderful home for the human soul. I saw that one of the flowers has faded. I went and sat next to him and petted him. Beautiful, fragrant, beautiful but faded! It still had all the features of a beautiful flower, but it was fading away. I caressed him a little, gave him a little water, sprinkled him with water, and saw that he was a little better. Then I thought to myself that sometimes the story of us people is also the story of this herd. Sometimes we appear to be a person with all his characteristics, but inside we are withering, we are getting depressed. We need someone to reach us, someone to caress us, someone to listen to us so that we feel better and get away from depression. I wish all people have at least one of these saviors in their lives.}}\par
