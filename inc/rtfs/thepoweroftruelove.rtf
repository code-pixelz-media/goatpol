\pard\nowidctlpar {{\cf0\f0 Love is a word which the world in general cannot give it a true meaning, which is why every individual uses the word in their own way which, however, often leads so many people to destruction because love probably has meanings because the dictionary gives us a definition on which beautiful numbers of people\uc0{\u8217}s lives depend on this definition according to the dictionary love is a feeling towards a person or something or according to it alone God, it defines love in many forms such as patient love, protected love, educated love, corrected love, transformed love, this is why today I would like us to truly understand love in one angle which, however, will allow us to cherish our brothers, sisters and the community in which we live.}}\par
\pard\nowidctlpar {{\cf0\f0 What is the power of true love?}}\par
\pard\nowidctlpar {{\cf0\f0 This is a question that we must probably understand at all costs and work on it, we ourselves will see as many changes in our life, in the dimensions we love we will first have to be able to love ourselves to say the love that transforms the person begins with oneself, it is impossible to transform someone else if we are incapable of transforming ourselves, since man is incapable of transforming himself that It will be impossible for his own society to have undergone a transformation. Now what is this true love? It is the art of being able to do something for the interest of others, even in African politics many of our brothers died because the leaders or presidents of the country do not have practical love for their brother because if the leaders would have had love the African continent would be a cradle of humanity unfortunately it has become a cemetery because the leader does not do for the population rather for their own family let\uc0{\u8217}s try to see the Westerners ruling all themselves fight for the interest of their country, to say that love has a character of which we men are unaware for our personal reasons.}}\par
\pard\nowidctlpar {{\cf0\f0 True love is the only way to return the other better than your neighbor to be able to define yourself depending on the act you are going to commit in your life, even in politics the same key works because we cannot say that we loved the development of the country during we care about ourselves to tell the truth love itself does not exist the same reality it is found in our families whose other wants their good and our not for others where is the love in itself this is why today people are killing themselves, my brothers God himself left his throne to save humanity by giving in his only son so that the entire universe could be saved, why not is not doing something in the interest of others to benefit from it listening even in entrepreneurship you should not do something for yourself but do it for many you will see that the organizations will develop because everyone will have taken this as its organization here is the power of a true love always for the interest of the other or for its community. So take the faults or weaknesses of others and make that your Inner strengths.}}\par
\pard\nowidctlpar {{\cf0\f0 Because where there is love that God speaks to us about, nothing is impossible. Love does not criticize but shows the way and the path, love does not discourage but love strengthens.}}\par
