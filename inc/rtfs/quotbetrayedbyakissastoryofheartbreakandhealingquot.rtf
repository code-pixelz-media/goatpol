\pard\nowidctlpar {{\cf0\f0 Once upon a time, there was a young woman named Azola. She was beautiful, kind-hearted, and had a great sense of humor. She lived a simple life, working as a nurse in a local hospital and helping care for her aging grandmother. She had a few close friends, but otherwise kept to herself.}}\par
\pard\nowidctlpar {{\cf0\f0 One day, Azola met a man named Banda. He was charming, funny, and swept her off her feet. They hit it off right away and started dating. Banda showered her with gifts, took her on romantic dates, and always made her feel special. Azola was overjoyed to have found someone who truly cared for her, and before she knew it, she was head over heels in love with Banda.}}\par
\pard\nowidctlpar {{\cf0\f0 But then, things started to change. Banda became more distant, and Azola noticed that he was spending a lot of time with a new friend named Mark. Mark was outgoing and seemed to have a way of getting Banda to do things he normally wouldn\uc0{\u8217}t. Despite her reservations, Azola trusted Banda and didn\uc0{\u8217}t think much of it.}}\par
\pard\nowidctlpar {{\cf0\f0 One day, Azola received a call from a mutual friend telling her that Banda and Mark had been seen out together at a bar, drinking and laughing. Azola was heartbroken, but she decided to confront Banda about it. When she did, Banda brushed it off, saying that he and Mark were just old friends catching up. Azola wanted to believe him, so she let it go.}}\par
\pard\nowidctlpar {{\cf0\f0 However, things took a turn for the worse when Banda started to come home late, sometimes not even coming home at all. Azola was beside herself with worry, and she begged Banda to tell her what was going on. He just brushed her off, saying that he was just working late or hanging out with friends.}}\par
\pard\nowidctlpar {{\cf0\f0 One night, Azola decided to follow Banda to see what he was really up to. She followed him to a hotel and watched in horror as he entered a room with Mark and another woman. Azola was devastated and felt like her world was crashing down around her. She confronted Banda the next day, and he finally confessed that he had been cheating on her with the woman in the hotel room. He told her that he had fallen in love with her, and that he didn\uc0{\u8217}t know what to do.}}\par
\pard\nowidctlpar {{\cf0\f0 Azola was beside herself with heartbreak and betrayal. She remembered the quote \uc0{\u8221}sometimes betrayal comes in a form of a kiss\uc0{\u8221} and realized that Banda had betrayed her in the most intimate way possible. She kicked him out of her life and tried to pick up the pieces of her broken heart.}}\par
\pard\nowidctlpar {{\cf0\f0 Despite her sadness, Azola was a strong woman, and she knew that she would eventually move on. She threw herself into her work and her grandmother, and before she knew it, she was healing. She realized that she deserved to be with someone who loved her for who she was, not just for what she could give them.Once upon a time, there was a young woman named Azola.
