\pard\nowidctlpar {{\cf0\f0 In the African\uc0{\u160} Shona context, identity acts as a reflection of your character or expectations as a human being.Some say the reason why we have totems was such that animals could be preserved and not become extinct. This owing to the reason that one is not allowed to eat his or her totem animal. An unending debate on the plausibility of this explanation still stands.}}\par

\pard\nowidctlpar {{\cf0\f0 Totems are basically animals to which a certain tribe resorts to for identity. People of the shumba totem have the lion as their identity animal denoting bravery and kingship.This tends to manifest in the way the people carry themselves around in the society with a feeling of self importance.Others are mhofu,the wildebeest; nyati, the buffalo and nzou, the elephant.Little is said about my totem,Hanzu or beta,which refers to termites and flying ants.Because of the totem\uc0{\u8217}s small stature,it tends to be forgotten and at times stimulates the laughing centre in peoples brains when mentioned in the public.Do these characteristics \uc0{\u8220}small\uc0{\u8221} and \uc0{\u8220}not worth the mention\uc0{\u8221} refer to the Hanzu people ?Definitely not and this is why;}}\par

\pard\nowidctlpar {{\cf0\f0 Coming from the eastern regions of Mozambique and Zimbabwe beginning from the ranges of the Inyangani mountains to the low lying areas of Bocha is a tribe boasting of a huge population of the Hanzu totem people.The flying ant itself appears during the rainy season and believed to bring the much awaited rains which mark an end to hunger and brings delight to the farmers.The ants appear from a molehill surrounded by termites which in this sense signify their delicacy and need for nature to protect the precious creature.When the ants come out to fly ,their feathers are easily pluckable and can fall off easily with the strong wind which is why the Hanzu people are very gentle,humble and peace loving people.To those people who eat the flying ants and termites,they are cooked and eaten with their feathers as nothing is worth throwing away.The molehill,their fortress , made of clay is a very rich source of iron.Most pregnant shona women tend to prefer this to quench their pica as opposed to the conventional iron tablets.}}\par
\pard\nowidctlpar {{\cf0\f0 \uc0{\u160}}}\par
\pard\nowidctlpar {{\cf0\f0 It has become fashionable for people to have their totem animals as huge portraits in their houses,statues in front of their gates as well as the names of the creatures printed on their car plates. The women belonging to the shumba,lion tribe delight in calling themselves Amasibanda. Those of the mhofu ,wildebeest tribe Achihera with a lot of glamorous associations coming with the titles.Have I ever seen a house with a portrait of a flying ant ,no.Have I seen the Amadhliwayos (women of the Hanzu tribe ) confidently introduce themselves by their identity? The answer is the same.Because of the stigma that emanates from the malice that comes out of peoples mouths when they hear of the flying ant as a totem,the beauty of tribe gets flattened and obscures the true reality and capability of the Beta people.}}\par
\pard\nowidctlpar {{\cf0\f0 \uc0{\u160}}}\par
\pard\nowidctlpar {{\cf0\f0 It\uc0{\u8217}s a mindset problem which I hope as a tribe we should transform from.We are of a greater value and prowess and made out of the finest raw materials of creation.The evidence of our existence is felt everywhere hence the sky is the beginning!}}\par
