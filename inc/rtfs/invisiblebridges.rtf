\pard\nowidctlpar {{\cf0\f0 What a tragedy is to be able to see beyond words and deeds,}}\par
\pard\nowidctlpar {{\cf0\f0 To see pain and silent screams hidden within eyes and smiles,}}\par
\pard\nowidctlpar {{\cf0\f0 To draw lines between their behavior and their past,}}\par
\pard\nowidctlpar {{\cf0\f0 To walk through the corridors of their broken parts,}}\par
\pard\nowidctlpar {{\cf0\f0 To see a masterpiece behind their bleeding scars.}}\par
\pard\nowidctlpar {{\cf0\f0 In every flaw, a hidden strength discovered,}}\par
\pard\nowidctlpar {{\cf0\f0 In every move, an unseen struggle uncovered.}}\par
\pard\nowidctlpar {{\cf0\f0 But I guess the tragedy begins when they draw scars on the walls of my tendered heart,}}\par
\pard\nowidctlpar {{\cf0\f0 Marked with their grief that still ache today.}}\par
\pard\nowidctlpar {{\cf0\f0 But instead of covering my scars with bandages,}}\par
\pard\nowidctlpar {{\cf0\f0 I drown in their gaze, seeing the reflection of my past dancing repeatedly,}}\par
\pard\nowidctlpar {{\cf0\f0 Questioning silently,}}\par
\pard\nowidctlpar {{\cf0\f0 Have my deeds triggered their broken parts?}}\par
\pard\nowidctlpar {{\cf0\f0 The parts that were imprisoned for so long,}}\par
\pard\nowidctlpar {{\cf0\f0 The parts that are yearning to break free from the chains.}}\par
\pard\nowidctlpar {{\cf0\f0 As though I\uc0{\u8217}m trying to illuminate the forgotten flames of my soul,}}\par
\pard\nowidctlpar {{\cf0\f0 To heal myself piece by piece,}}\par
\pard\nowidctlpar {{\cf0\f0 To give what I couldn\uc0{\u8217}t have\uc0{\u8230}.}}\par
