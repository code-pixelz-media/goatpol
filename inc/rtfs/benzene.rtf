\pard\nowidctlpar {{\cf0\f0 I had a friend who loved the smell of benzene in the filling station. Guess where he works now, a filling station?! Nope, he works at a morgue. That\uc0{\u8217}s how the hand of fate works.}}\par
\pard\nowidctlpar {{\cf0\f0 I asked him if it was tough, he said, \uc0{\u8220}It\uc0{\u8217}s a job.\uc0{\u8221} Right on, it\uc0{\u8217}s a job.}}\par
\pard\nowidctlpar {{\cf0\f0 I feel like it has affected him, he no longer believes afterlife exists. He says, \uc0{\u8220}the only difference between me and a butcher is I don\uc0{\u8217}t slaughter bodies.\uc0{\u8221}}}\par
\pard\nowidctlpar {{\cf0\f0 He\uc0{\u8217}s bought himself grave. He says, \uc0{\u8220}Graves are getting more expensive daily, I\uc0{\u8217}ll sell it and buy a car instead.\uc0{\u8221}\uc0{\u160}}}\par
\pard\nowidctlpar {{\cf0\f0 He doesn\uc0{\u8217}t care if they bury him in a ditch in the backyard or a ditch in the graveyard. He says, \uc0{\u8220}When I\uc0{\u8217}m dead, does it matter?!\uc0{\u8221}}}\par
\pard\nowidctlpar {{\cf0\f0 A while ago, when we went to fill up the tank, I asked him if he still likes the smell of benzene. He paused and took a deep breath, \uc0{\u8220}oof\uc0{\u8230} I\uc0{\u8217}ve forgotten,\uc0{\u8221} he said with a crooked smile.}}\par
\pard\nowidctlpar {{\cf0\f0 People easily forget what they like until someone reminds them.}}\par
