\pard\nowidctlpar {{\cf0\f0 Willy would have long peached up if not hindered by significant distractions and obstacles early every morning before 8 bells, which was the hour at which Willy Health and Beauty center officially opened its doors to the general public. Without the presence of the man who held the saloon\uc0{\u8217}s keys on that particular day, the clock had chimed the set opening time. As per usual, Lisa and her coworkers arrived at half past seven to start the opening preparations, which included cleaning, setting up furniture, and setting up equipment to make sure everything was in order before customers arrived. Before opening the doors to Willy\uc0{\u8217}s Health and Beauty Centre, the ladies always make sure that the entire facility is immaculately clean. They were astounded to see their always-on-time boss fly in an hour past the scheduled start time. As he checked into the mall, Willy\uc0{\u8217}s presence was always announced by the loud raving of the constantly mistreated beast, which had become his arrival and departure password that had been lost for the required amount of time. The beast eventually moaned and stumbled onto its normal parking spot.}}\par
\pard\nowidctlpar {{\cf0\f0 \uc0{\u8220}Morning everybody, sorry for the inconvenience caused, I had mechanical problems with my vehicle\uc0{\u8221} he explained himself to the onlooking staff.}}\par
\pard\nowidctlpar {{\cf0\f0 \uc0{\u8220}No problem Willy\uc0{\u8221} responded Lisa who had a knack for speaking on behalf of the other girls at loose will.}}\par
\pard\nowidctlpar {{\cf0\f0 Willy was busy persuading the three clients who had come for services to bear with them as they rapidly put their ducks in a row while the girls ran inside to make up for the lost time. Willy\uc0{\u8217}s typical professional demeanor had taken a hit from the previous tumultuous night. He had a reputation for having strong, well-honed business idiosyncrasies, but they were undermined by his crazy hunger for the things that God put between women\uc0{\u8217}s legs. Womanising}}\par
\pard\nowidctlpar {{\cf0\f0 Seems to have been a breach that was nonetheless adhered to his otherwise spotless fabric. The saloon had opened late on that particular day due to such gallivanting. He had several one-night stands over the years, but he always made it to the saloon on time. However, that particular day, what happened with Lady Lydia was a deciding factor. Those ferocious screams were the product of a remarkable body and intense passion. We will learn as we follow their turbulent, private experience whether it was passion or love that prevailed at Verandah resort. Their intimacy had to fulfill its purpose, or at the very least, give it its utmost effort. Perhaps after that wonderful experience, the Just a matter of time until the much-needed baby arrived. But despite this, work had to come first on the list of priorities because it funded these adventures. All of that was, however, history by this point, and it was time to adjust the saloon\uc0{\u8217}s decor and, potentially, make another one-night catch, which had been his custom. It was back to business as normal in no time. His peculiar position on that particular day astounded Lisa and everyone else. He wasn\uc0{\u8217}t really interacting with anyone but was grinning to himself. That particular day, there was something peculiar about his attitude that suggested a whole unique world. Anyhow, many people are prone to mood changes, and He didn\uc0{\u8217}t represent an angelic outlier.}}\par
\pard\nowidctlpar {{\cf0\f0 If Lydia\uc0{\u8217}s scream or screech was any indication from the other side, she was still recovering from the sexual beating she had to undergo. The adorable baby hunter was thinking back on the fun and unnecessary night that had just passed. She had never in her life faced a bedroom creepy crawler with such a passionate nostalgia for closeness. Yes, it had never occurred to her that a man would smash it left, right, and center all night long without showing any sign of stopping since she had lost her virginity. Perhaps this was the illusive answer to her lifelong desire for a child of her own. She couldn\uc0{\u8217}t help but wonder if the baby-making charms her husband had purchased from Somalia were real. A week before she met the marauding dreadlocked beast, had worked well during her contact with her missing husband. Beyond that brief period of reflection, the likelihood that she would become pregnant was what counted. She had already had enough negative feedback from judgmental and stereotypical family members, friends, and onlookers. She had long wished there was a way to escape this stigmatizing chain. She had made a vow to have a child by all means necessary or perish trying. She did not have the word \uc0{\u8221}give up\uc0{\u8221} in her lexicon of reproduction. Groaning in bed all night without getting anything out of your endurance is a horrible experience. In any event, fertility is a gift from providence rather than a predetermined individual right. Destiny and the divine.}}\par
