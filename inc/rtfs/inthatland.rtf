\pard\nowidctlpar {{\cf0\f0 There\uc0{\u8217}s a dwelling in the hills,Where God did not know,Humans don\uc0{\u8217}t live there,Only people with broken souls,Teary eyes, and ashe skin,People who do not know their essence.}}\par
\pard\nowidctlpar {{\cf0\f0 They had parties at night with bullets,And drink from their sweat,Their style of music is unusualAs their sound of drumsOnly remind them that It\uc0{\u8217}s time;Time to kill or to be killed.}}\par
