\pard\nowidctlpar {{\cf0\f0 My desire for life no longer pulls me forward.It\uc0{\u8217}s not that I lack hunger\uc0{\u8212}no, not at all.But this hunger feels like one gut devouring another.And if I claimed that life never laid a table before me, I\uc0{\u8217}d be lying, my dear.Yet, the things placed on this spread\uc0{\u8212}colorful and varied\uc0{\u8212}have often struck me like a slap in the face. But let that be aside.Who shared this table with me? That\uc0{\u8217}s a question for another time.Many times, I\uc0{\u8217}ve wanted to rise from this feast still hungry, but what could I do? I was compelled to stay.But sitting at this table doesn\uc0{\u8217}t mean I\uc0{\u8217}ve been satisfied; I\uc0{\u8217}ve often remained hungry.There have been moments when I felt full without taking a single bite,and countless times, I\uc0{\u8217}ve wanted to throw up everything I hadn\uc0{\u8217}t eaten.Now, however, I\uc0{\u8217}m left with a table that, despite being laden with food, seems empty.I can no longer rise; it\uc0{\u8217}s as if someone has chained my legs to the ground.But what can I do?Since I remain hungry at this colorful spread, at least let me not rise thirsty.May I take a cup? If not, then please, just fill it with water.}}\par
