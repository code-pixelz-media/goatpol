\pard\nowidctlpar {{\cf0\f0 Once upon a time, there was a young woman named Sunflower. She lived in a small town on the outskirts of a big city and had always dreamed of finding true love. She had been in a few relationships before, but none of them had felt quite right.}}\par
\pard\nowidctlpar {{\cf0\f0 One day, Sunflower decided to try online dating. She created a profile on a popular dating site and started browsing through the profiles of other singles in her area. That\uc0{\u8217}s when she stumbled upon a profile that caught her eye. It belonged to a man named Divin, who lived in the city but worked as a freelance writer and spent a lot of time traveling.}}\par
\pard\nowidctlpar {{\cf0\f0 Sunflower was immediately drawn to Divin\uc0{\u8217}s profile. He seemed intelligent, funny, and adventurous \uc0{\u8211} everything she was looking for in a partner. She decided to take a chance and send him a message, and to her surprise, he responded right away.}}\par
\pard\nowidctlpar {{\cf0\f0 Over the next few weeks, Sunflower and Divin exchanged messages and got to know each other better. They discovered that they had a lot in common, including a love of music, a sense of humor, and a passion for exploring new places. They decided to meet in person, and Sunflower was thrilled when Divin suggested they go on a hike in a nearby state park.}}\par
\pard\nowidctlpar {{\cf0\f0 The day of their date arrived, and Sunflower nervously drove to the park to meet Divin. When she saw him standing by his car, she felt a flutter in her stomach. He was even more handsome in person than he was in his photos. As they hiked through the park, Sunflower and Divin talked and laughed and enjoyed each other\uc0{\u8217}s company. They stopped at a scenic overlook to take in the view, and Divin pulled out a blanket and some snacks he had brought along. They sat together on the blanket, watching the sunset and talking about their hopes and dreams. That\uc0{\u8217}s when Divin leaned in and kissed Sunflower. It was a gentle, sweet kiss that made her heart skip a beat. From that moment on, Sunflower knew that she was falling in love with Divin. Over the next few months, Sunflower and Divin went on many more dates and grew closer and closer. They traveled to new cities, tried new restaurants, and went to concerts and shows together. They talked about their future and what they wanted out of life, and they realized that they were on the same page about almost everything. One night, as they were walking along the beach, Divin stopped and turned to Sunflower. \uc0{\u8221}I know we haven\uc0{\u8217}t been together for very long,\uc0{\u8221} he said, \uc0{\u8221}but I can\uc0{\u8217}t imagine my life without you. Sunflower, will you be my girlfriend?\uc0{\u8221} Sunflower\uc0{\u8217}s heart swelled with happiness. \uc0{\u8221}Yes,\uc0{\u8221} she said, throwing her arms around Divin\uc0{\u8217}s neck. \uc0{\u8221}Yes, I will.\uc0{\u8221}}}\par
\pard\nowidctlpar {{\cf0\f0 From that moment on, Sunflower and Divin were inseparable. They fell deeply in love and knew that they had found their soulmate in each other. They continued to explore the world together, making memories and building a life that was full of love, laughter, and adventure. And they lived happily ever after.}}\par
