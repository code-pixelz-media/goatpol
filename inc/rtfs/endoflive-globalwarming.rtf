\pard\nowidctlpar {{\cf0\f0 Global warming is the long term increase in Earth\uc0{\u8217}s average temperature due to human activities which causes the release of greenhouse gases into the atmosphere. Gases such carbon dioxide and methane trap heat from the sun and prevent it from escaping back into space, causing a warmer environment on the planet.The main human activities that contribute to global warming include the burning of fossil fuels (such as coal, oil, and natural gas) for energy production, transportation, and industrial processes. Deforestation and agriculture also release significant amounts of greenhouse gases into the atmosphere.As the concentration of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere increases, more heat is trapped near the Earth\uc0{\u8217}s surface, causing temperatures to rise. This leads to a range of negative impacts, including melting ice caps, rising sea levels, more frequent and severe weather events, and disruptions to ecosystems and wildlife.To address global warming, it is crucial to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by transitioning to cleaner and more sustainable energy sources, improving energy efficiency, and implementing policies to mitigate climate change.}}\par
