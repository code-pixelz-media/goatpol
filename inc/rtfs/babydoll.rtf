\pard\nowidctlpar {{\cf0\f0 On my armpits I am braiding my hairAnd vomitting you a nice blanketIt is past your bed time againLet me take your human skin jacket}}\par
\pard\nowidctlpar {{\cf0\f0 The nuns are crying, rushing to get insideThey got scared of the shotgun in my handMy friend watching my brother sleep by his bed sideI hate turtles, what don\uc0{\u8217}t you understand?}}\par

\pard\nowidctlpar {{\cf0\f0 Blood makes such nice burgundy paintI could draw raspberries that wayOr the tears of a saintI regret not punching you that day}}\par
\pard\nowidctlpar {{\cf0\f0 My baby doll gets on my nerves latelyI ripped her clothers and made them confettiShe was the talk with no brain kind of galI would know, as I opened her skull}}\par
