\pard\nowidctlpar {{\cf0\f0 In the peaceful minutes before morning, when the world was still wrapped in the hushed embrace of slumber, I found myself immersed in a moment of intense meditation. My father\uc0{\u8217}s recollections flashed through my memory like bits of a beloved dream, each one a tribute to the love and wisdom he had given upon me throughout his brief time on earth.}}\par
\pard\nowidctlpar {{\cf0\f0 I never got to know my father fully, not because I didn\uc0{\u8217}t want to, but because he died when I was six years old. His departure left a great vacuum within me, which I attempted to bridge while I navigated the turbulent seas of adolescence. While other youngsters rejoiced in their parents\uc0{\u8217} soothing presence, I felt myself adrift, pining for a bond that had been broken much too soon.}}\par
\pard\nowidctlpar {{\cf0\f0 In the aftermath of his death, sadness became a constant companion, a shadow that followed me wherever I went. I questioned the justice of a world that could take away a beloved father, leaving only memories of his laughter and unfinished discussions.}}\par
\pard\nowidctlpar {{\cf0\f0 Despite the darkness that tried to overwhelm me, there was a glimpse of light, a whisper of peace that resonated deep inside my spirit. Even in death, my father had never fully abandoned me. His soul remained in the corners of my mind, a quiet guardian that watched over me with undying affection.}}\par
\pard\nowidctlpar {{\cf0\f0 I recall small evidence of his presence, little periods of clarity in which his essence appeared to brush against mine. In the silence of darkness, I\uc0{\u8217}d feel his delicate touch on my shoulder, a murmured comfort that I wasn\uc0{\u8217}t alone in this huge and frightening world.}}\par
\pard\nowidctlpar {{\cf0\f0 But as the years passed, the warnings of well-meaning family and preachers threw a pall on my relationship with my father\uc0{\u8217}s spirit. They cautioned me about the hazards of communicating with the dead, as well as the risks of letting him into my life. And so, with a sad heart, I hid my father\uc0{\u8217}s recollections deep inside the caverns of my memory, frightened of the consequences of defying tradition.}}\par
\pard\nowidctlpar {{\cf0\f0 Despite my best efforts to bury the echoes of the past, my father\uc0{\u8217}s presence remained vigilant over my life. In the solitude of my nightmares, he would appear to me, his words a comforting balm against the sharp edges of my uncertainties. He helped me through life\uc0{\u8217}s ups and downs, imparting wisdom that transcended time and geography.}}\par
\pard\nowidctlpar {{\cf0\f0 Life became a relentless pursuit of success. Seeing friends showered with newfound wealth fueled a burning desire in me. A friend, privy to their secret, offered me a way in \uc0{\u8211} a witch doctor, a whisper of dark magic. The fear was real, but my yearning for security was stronger. We entered the dimly lit hut, the air thick with anticipation. The witch doctor, hunched over his instruments, turned. To my utter bewilderment, he screamed, his eyes wild with terror. \uc0{\u8221}Leave! There\uc0{\u8217}s someone with her\uc0{\u8230}\uc0{\u8221} He pointed at me, \uc0{\u8221}a powerful protector!\uc0{\u8221} We were ushered out, my friend bewildered, me strangely comforted. My father, it seemed, was watching over me even from beyond.}}\par
\pard\nowidctlpar {{\cf0\f0 Then followed marriage, a happy and optimistic union. Our excitement was increased when we learned that we were expecting a child. But fate appeared to have other intentions. My wife\uc0{\u8217}s pregnancy went on for weeks and months, with no signs of labor. The physicians were mystified, and my heart was heavy with concern. Finally, they proposed having a caesarean. Panic grabbed at me. My father, the one person I wished I could turn to for assistance, had passed away. Or was he?}}\par
\pard\nowidctlpar {{\cf0\f0 In that moment of desperation, all the memories and comforting whispers came together. My eyes closed, and my heart made a quiet appeal. \uc0{\u8221}Dad,\uc0{\u8221} I said, \uc0{\u8221}I need you.\uc0{\u8221} Please be with her and assist her in making a safe delivery. If you do this, I pledge to respect you and acknowledge your existence in my life.}}\par
\pard\nowidctlpar {{\cf0\f0 A peculiar sense rushed over me, one of certainty and presence. Looking out the window of the maternity ward, I noticed a man with a familiar smile. As I stood to shout out, the person vanished. Minutes afterward, a nurse emerged, grinning. \uc0{\u8221}It\uc0{\u8217}s a boy!\uc0{\u8221} she said. Relief flowed through me like a tidal wave of joy and thankfulness. My baby is a live monument to my father\uc0{\u8217}s love, a link between the worlds.}}\par
\pard\nowidctlpar {{\cf0\f0 This experience transformed my life. I embraced the spirituality of my ancestors, a world where the veil between the living and the dead is thin. It\uc0{\u8217}s a message I share with anyone who grieves, anyone who feels lost. Our loved ones, even in their absence, are never truly gone. They exist in a different plane, watching over us, guiding us, waiting for us to acknowledge them. All we need is faith, an open heart, and the courage to reach out.}}\par
\pard\nowidctlpar {{\cf0\f0 This is not the conclusion of my story. It\uc0{\u8217}s a beginning, a tribute to the eternal power of love, the unbreakable tie between a father and son, and the understanding that even death cannot cut the strands that bind us together. My quest continues, accompanied by the spirit of my father, the defender, guide, and silent hero who taught me the most important lesson of all: love transcends the limits of existence.}}\par
